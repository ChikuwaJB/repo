<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
mp3DirectCut is a <b>frame based</b> editor for <b>MPEG audio</b> (Layers 2 and 3) and <b>AAC</b>. Frame based means:
Instead of pcm samples you work on the encoded frame structure. One frame alway keeps a defined number of samples.
You can cut, copy, paste or change the volume <b>without re-encoding</b> anything. This makes mp3DirectCut very fast and
prevents loss of audio quality. The program provides <b>easiest navigation</b> even on large files (up to 4GB) and gives you
a fast <b>visualisation</b> of the compressed audio data. It can handle <b>Cue sheets</b> allowing to split a file at cue
positions. Additionally you can directly <b>record and encode</b> to MP3 from your audio input devices.
</p>

<a name="quick"></a>
<h2>Quick guides</h2>
<h3>General usage</h3>
<p>
Open a file: <i>File > Open</i>, or use Drag+drop. Prelisten with <span>&nbsp;Play&nbsp;</span> / <span>&nbsp;Stop&nbsp;</span>
or Spacebar. Navigate through track: Cursor left/right, Page up/down, Mousewheel, click into map area (below audio graph),
Scrollbar, or Ctrl+click into graph.
</p>
<h3>Cutting a part of audio</h3>
<p>
Where the part to be removed begins: drag the selection start with the left mouse button in the audio graph, or press
<span>&nbsp;Set begin&nbsp;</span> or B to set the selection beginning to the yellow play position. Where the cut shall end click/drag
with the right mouse button in the graph, or press <span>&nbsp;Set end&nbsp;</span> or N. To prelisten the cut press
<span>&nbsp;=&gt;I...I=&gt&nbsp;</span>. Adjust the selection with the right mouse button or the keys 1-4. To cut press the
<span>&nbsp;Cut/Cue&nbsp;</span> button in the lower panel or the Del key. Use normal play to control the Cut.
Save the file: <i>File > Save all audio</i>.
</p>
<h3>Extracting a part of audio</h3>
<p>
Where the part shall begin: make a selection by dragging with the left mouse button in the audio graph, or press
<span>&nbsp;Set begin&nbsp;</span> or B to set the selection beginning to the yellow play position. At the end of the wanted part
click/drag with the right mouse button, or press <span>&nbsp;Set end&nbsp;</span> or N. To prelisten the range use the buttons
<span>&nbsp;I=&gt;..&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;..=&gt;I&nbsp;</span> or the keys F6 and F7. Adjust the selection with the
right mouse button or the keys 1-4. Save the selected range: <i>File > Save selection</i>.
</p>
<h3>Split into multiple files</h3>
<p>
At a desired split position add a point selection: only click (not drag) with the left mouse button into the audio graph. To create the
split point press <span>&nbsp;Cut/Cue&nbsp;</span> in the lower panel or the Del key. <b>All split points must show a dotted line!</b>
(If for some reason the line is not dotted: highlight the point by placing the yellow play position after it, press Ctrl+Q to set the "Cue flag".)
Adjust a split point by dragging the gray handle with the right mouse button. To jump to a split point press
<span>&nbsp;&gt;I&nbsp;</span> or <span>&nbsp;I&lt;&nbsp;</span>. To load a Cue sheet (a file which contains split points), open
the cue sheet file, not the audio file. If the program does not find the audio file for a Cue sheet, open the audio file and then select
<i> Special > Load Cue sheet over current audio file</i>. To split the track select <i>File > Save split</i>.
</p>
<h3>Fade in/out</h3>
<p>
At the end of the wanted fade-in-range create a point selection: only click (not drag) with the left mouse button into the audio graph.
The selection must be a dotted line! Press <span>&nbsp;Cut&nbsp;</span>. With the left mouse button drag the gray handle at the
track beginning from 0.0 down to e.g. -48.0 dB. Play from the track beginning with <span>&nbsp;Rew&nbsp;</span> and
<span>&nbsp;Play&nbsp;</span>. Same procedure for fade out: create a point some seconds before the end of the track, drag the
gray handle at the track end. You can always adjust the points by dragging the handle (left mouse button = volume, right = position).
You can also use multiple points for complex fade curves. On AAC or MP2 gain adjustment is not possible.
</p>
<h3>Add, move, remove a Cue</h3>
<p>
Add a cue/index: Click once (not drag!) into the audio where the cue shall be. If the vertical line is dotted (means cue),
press Del. Note: Mouse selection method should be the default: "Left=new+drag / Right=Nearest" - see settings. Move a
cue: Drag the gray small handle of a dotted line with the right mose button. Remove a cue: Hightlight it by moving the
play cursor behind it, press E. Convert to a cue: Hightlight the edit point by moving the play cursor behind it, press Ctrl+Q
</p>



<a name="basic"></a>
<h2>Basic settings</h2>
<p>
To play files, the program uses a decoder library. For <b>MP3</b> this usually is the system provided <b>ACM Codec</b>
(Windows since XP contains it by default). The <b>mpglib.dll</b> can be used for <b>MP2</b> playing and alternatively for MP3.
It must be in the program folder or system path (e.g. Windows folder). For <b>AAC</b> play you need the free <b>libfaad2.dll</b>
(also working: a renamed ff_libfaad2.dll from ffdshow) in the program folder or system path. The libfaad2.dll needs the MSVC 9.0 runtimes.
</p><p>
Switch to your prefered MP3 decoder in the Devices settings (Settings > Configure > Devices). In the Output device section you can
select a Wave device and adjust the amount of frames being decoded to each play buffer between "fast" (1 frame) and "reliable"
(8 frames). On slower machines set a higher value. For a fast response of the graphics select a lower value. The default is 4.
</p><p>
The program <b>language</b> can be adjusted in the Operation Tab (Settings > Configure > Operation). In the list select
your language if present. The language files must be in a sub directory "Languages" of the mp3DirectCut folder. If no
language is selected or found, the program looks also into its own folder for one (!) language file. So you also can enable
your language without keeping the subfolder (but then it does not appear in the list).
</p><p>
<b>Fullscreen view</b> is not recommended. It takes more CPU - without information benefit,
as the resolution of the mpeg graph is much lower than the display resolution on fullscreen.
</p>

<a name="nav"></a>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
As mp3DirectCut is designed to handle large files, there are many ways to reach a position:
</p><p>
<b>Scrollbar</b><br>
With the slider you can move along a file. The arrow buttons (or <b>keys:</b> Shift+Left/Right)
move a single MPEG frame backwards or forward.
</p><p>
<b><span>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span> and keys: Left/Right and Page up/down</b><br>
These buttons/keys are user definable. You can set the amount of frames to skip back/forward
in the configuration window between 10 and 10.000 for <span>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</span> and
<span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span> and between 1 and 1.000 for <span>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span>. For 44 kHz tracks, 38 frames means about 1 second, 383 skip 10 seconds.
</p><p>
<b>Mouse wheel</b><br>
No key: slow scroll, Shift: fast scroll, Ctrl: zoom, Shift+Ctrl: volume.
</p><p>
<b>Mouse into map</b><br>
You can directly jump to any file position by left clicking into the map area below the audio graph.
</p><p>
<b>Ctrl+Mouse</b><br>
If you hold down the Ctrl key while clicking into the audio graph the cursor jumps to the shown audio position.
</p><p>
<b><span>&nbsp;I..&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;>>..I&nbsp;</span></b><br>
These buttons set the play cursor to the beginning or the end of the selection if present.
</p><p>
<b>List Menu and <span>&nbsp;I&lt;&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;>I&nbsp;</span></b><br>
Let you choose the active edit point and set the play cursor to it's beginning.
</p><p>
<b>Position field</b><br>
You can enter a position by time or percentage into the edit field and apply the value by pressing Enter or Tab.
</p>

<a name="edit"></a>
<h2>Audio editing</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Editing a file or compilation of file fragments means to create different <b>parts</b> of audio content.
Each time you cut or set a cue/gain point, your track will be devided into more parts. Every edit point
is the beginning of a new part. Each part together with its function is shown in the <b>List</b> menu.
</p><p>
Like in other editors, editing begins by making a <b>selection</b>. A selection can be an audio <b>range</b> or only
a single <b>position point</b> (dotted line). Ranges can be used to cut, copy or paste. A point selection is for creating
cues or points of volume change.
</p>
<h3>Make a selection</h3>
<p>
You have these ways:
</p><p>
<b>Buttons <span>&nbsp;Set begin&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;Set end&nbsp;</span></b><br>
These buttons set the beginning or the end of the selection to the current position.
</p><p>
<b>Mouse</b><br>
You can point/drag a selection by using the left and the right mouse button. How the buttons behave can be set in the
preferences: <b>Method 1:</b> Left button sets the beginning of the selection (by clicking or dragging), the right button
sets the end. <b>Method 2:</b> Left button makes a new selection and enlarges it. The right button moves beginning or
end (depending on which is nearer).
</p><p class="note">
Note: to make a large selection you should at first point to one end of the selection and then jump to where the other end should
be and set it there. It is not possible to drag a long selection by moving the mouse over the windows borders.
</p><p>
<b>Selection field</b><br>
You can enter beginning, end or length of the selection
by numbers. Take care not to delete the symbols, otherwise
the values cannot be read from the field correctly.
</p>
<h3>Part structure</h3>
<p>
At each edit point an independent audio part begins. Parts can even be
from <b>different audio files</b>. Each part can have information about a <b>volume
change</b> or whether it is a <b>cue</b>.
</p><p>
If you <b>cut</b> a selection the range disappears and is not longer known by
the program. But an edit point remains at the cut position and you can <b>restore</b>
the cut range every time by using the edit button.
</p>
<h3>The buttons <i>Cut</i> and <i>Edit</i></h3>
<p>
The <b>Cut</b> button splits the current audio part into two parts.
If there was a selection range, it will be cut. If the selection
had a length of zero, the Cut function only splits the part. The split point
can be used to create a volume change (see below) point or a cue.
</p><p>
If a split point should work as a cue (e.g. for creating a Cue sheet),
its <b>cue flag</b> must be set. The program sets it automatically on creating a split point
or loading a Cue sheet. Edit points with cue flag are shown as <b>dotted line</b>. To set
or remove a cue flag manually, press Ctrl+Q or check/uncheck "Cue" in the part
properties dialog (Edit menu).
</p><p>
With the <b>Edit</b> button you can <b>remove existing edit points</b>. This
means that two parts will be joined. If the edit point was a cut, the removed
audio range will be restored.
</p><p class="note">Note: editing a point is not possible,
if it was created by paste. In this case the audio data between two parts
is not continouus and there is nothing to restore. To remove such insertions
select them and use the function "Remove selected elements" in the Edit menu.
</p>
<h3>Edit menu: Cut, Copy, Paste</h3>
<p>
While the Cut button does <b>not</b> copy the cut range to the clipboard,
Cut and Copy from the Edit menu do. The copied information can be pasted
to any new position (current or selection). Copy and Paste can handle multiple files
and parts and work completely non-destructive. This means that no audio data
is copied but only access informations.
</p>
<h3>Volume changes</h3>
<p>
To change the volume, simply create one or more edit points (from zero length selections, see above).
Then you can directly change the gain by dragging the <b>gray handles</b> with the
<b>left mouse button</b>. Alternatively the gain of the highlighted edit point can be changed
by the keys <b>Ctrl+Up/Down</b>. To move an edit point, drag it with the <b>right mouse button</b>.
</p><p>
Audio ranges with a modified volume are shown in the color of edit points.
The gain sign of the edit point shows the volume change in dB.
</p><p class="note">Note: Volume change works only with MP3.
As the data remains encoded, volume changes can only be made in a resolution of 1.5 dB steps. 
Gain adjustment on AAC or MP2 is not possible.
</p><p>
Using the <b>Gain dialog</b> is only recommended for special purposes like silencing an area or for setting
the <b>"Lowest gain"</b>, which is also used by <b>Simple fade</b>, <b>Two-stage fade</b> and <b>Auto crop</b>.
<b>"Lowest gain"</b> can also be set in the configuration dialog. <b>Fades</b> should be be created by manually
dragging edit points or with the <b>Simple fade</b> or <b>Two-stage fade</b> functions.
</p>
<h3>Change or remove existing edit points</h3>
<p>
For simply moving a cue or volume change point, drag it with the <b>right mouse button</b>
(or use Alt+Left/Right for the highlighted point).
</p><p>
To edit an existing cut, move to its position to highlight it.
After pressing <span>&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;</span> the cut range or the split point will become the
selection and will be deleted. After changing positions hit <span>&nbsp;Cut&nbsp;</span> again to store
the changes in the new cut. If the edit point had title names or a volume change, these
data will be kept with the selection and also stored to the new cut.
</p><p>
The <b>Trim</b> function allows directly changing the boundaries of an existing cut
without converting it to a selection. With the keys <b>Ctrl+1/2/3/4</b> you can shift
audio data on the left or right side of the cut in or out.
</p>

<a name="pre"></a>
<h2>Prelisten and save</h2>
<p>
Normal play already is a prelisten mode because every cut and every gain modification is played as it will be
saved. In addition there are some buttons to prelisten the selection boundaries:
</p><p>
<b><span>&nbsp;=&gt;I..&nbsp;</span></b> or F5 - play region* <b>to</b> the selection <b>beginning</b><br>
<b><span>&nbsp;I=&gt;..&nbsp;</span></b> or F6 - play region* <b>from</b> the selection <b>beginning</b><br>
<b><span>&nbsp;..=&gt;I&nbsp;</span></b> or F7 - play region* <b>to</b> the selection <b>end</b><br>
<b><span>&nbsp;..I=&gt;&nbsp;</span></b> or F8 - play region* <b>from</b> the selection <b>end</b><br>
</p><p>
<b><span>&nbsp;=&gt;I...I=&gt;&nbsp;</span></b> or F9: play the selection <b>as cut</b> (region* before and after the selection)
</p><p>
To play the selection <b>looped</b> press F4.
</p><p>
* The prelisten time can be adjusted in the Settings dialog. Default is two seconds.
</p><p>
In play mode, two of the prelisten buttons change their function to provide <b>Fast Play</b>.
The buttons show the symbols <b><span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span></b> and
<b><span>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;+&nbsp;</span></b> and can be used to adjust the
speed of Fast Play in small steps. For faster operation it's recommended to use F7 and F8.
</p><p>
<b>Save complete audio...</b> saves the complete shown audio data as edited.<br>
<b>Save selection...</b> saves or only the range of the selection.<br>
<b>Save split...</b> creates seperate files for every range <b>between two cues</b>.
</p><p class="note">
Note: You should check the output file(s) before deleting the original.
</p>

<a name="spc"></a>
<h2>Pause detection</h2>
<p>
This function sets cues or cuts to gaps of definable length and level. The settings must be adjusted carefully
because the results can be very different.
</p><p>
The <b>Level</b> and the <b>Duration</b> sliders adjust at which audio level and gap
duration thresholds a pause will be detected.
<b>Offset</b> is the number of frames at the pause end which the cue will be shifted to the left or right.
<b>Cut whole pause</b> means that not only a cue at the pause end will be created
but a cut over the whole pause (beginning of cut slightly right shifted) if the pause is long enough.
Don't use the Cut option when you want to create only a Cue sheet!
</p><p>
The value of <b>"After a pause detection skip"</b> can be used to speed up
the detection process. If a pause is found, the program jumps further the entered
amount of seconds. E.g. if you know that all of the tracks of your CD image are
3 minutes or longer, you could set this value to 150 seconds.
</p>

<a name="rec"></a>
<h2>Recording</h2>
<p>
For recording MP3 directly, you need either an ACM Codec with encoding capability
or the Lame Encoder DLL (available through the homepage of the Lame project). It is
important to choose a <b>base filename</b>. Your recordings will be saved under this name.
Note that there will be no query for overwriting existing files! If you select <b>Add date & time</b>
each recorded file will have a date and time stamp in its filename.
</p><p>
To initialize recording, press <span>&nbsp;Rec&nbsp;</span>. Then you can see the audio input level on the VU meter.
After pressing <span>&nbsp;Play&nbsp;</span> the file starts being written. With selected <b>Append data</b>
in the recording settings an existing file will not be deleted and you can make multiple recordings
to one file. But take care not to use different bitrates or samplerates in one file. On <b>appending
in VBR mode</b> you will only see the time of the current recording in <b>round brackets</b>.
</p><p>
While the recording you can set up to 40 cues by pressing <span>&nbsp;Set begin&nbsp;</span>. The number
and position of the last cue is shown in the range field.
</p><p>
The value of <b>Buffer</b> shows how much data is waiting to be encoded by the codec. If it grows,
the codec is not fast enough to encode MP3 in realtime. The unencoded buffer portion should not be
over 10% for more than some seconds. On modern systems it should be always 0%.
</p><p>
If you launch mp3DirectCut with <b>"/rec"</b> in the command line, it will start the recording
immediately with the encoding settings of your last session. You can use this option for automated
recordings. See more under Command line options.
</p>

<a name="fea"></a>
<h2>More features</h2>
<p>
The <b>Margin</b> button shows the room between the highest gain and the
maximum of 0 dB since play or record was started. It helps to see how much
gain reserve is left e.g. when you record something.
Pressing the button resets the display to seek for the next lowest margin.
</p><p>
The <b>Normalize</b> function seeks the whole file (or the selection) for the highest gain.
If there is room to the maximum of 0 dB, it suggests the corresponding gain raise. Scanning
the file may be slow, because for searching peaks it must be temporarily decoded.
Gain adjustment is not possible on AAC or MP2.
</p><p>
<b>Auto cue</b> lets you split large tracks into small segements of the same length.
This is especially useful for listening to long tracks (e.g. audio books) on hardware
players with missing or slow seek capability. Auto cue affects either the whole file, if
nothing was selected, or just the selection. After setting the cues you can call "Save split..."
and choose a destination for writing the file series.
</p><p>
<b>Auto crop</b> removes silences at the beginning and the end of the track automatically.
The silence ("lower") level can be adjusted in the <b>Gain dialog</b> (select a range before calling).
The accuracy of the function cannot be guaranteed. You should check the result before saving.
</p>

<a name="prj"></a>
<h2>Project files and Cue Sheets</h2>
<p>
An mp3DirectCut project file (*.mpd) contains a complete edit state
with every part and their volume, cut and cue informations.
If you work with large files and make a lot of cuts you should frequently save
your work to a project file.
</p><p>
Cue Sheets (*.cue) contain a link to an audio file and time indexes (cues).
Cuts and gain settings cannot be saved to a Cue sheet.
A Cue sheet can't even be saved if the audio file has been edited in the length
at the same time.
When loading a cue sheet the program reads titles and artist
names and shows them in the graph area. If you split a file
by using a Cue sheet you can create filenames with titles and
ID3v1.1 tags for each file.

<h2>Command line options</h2>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>
<i>mp3DirectCut.exe &lt;filename&gt; &lt;option(s)&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</i>
</p><p>
As <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> every file type known by mp3DirectCut is possible
(MP3, MP2, Project files, Cue sheets). Usually this is simply for a file to be opened.
In your operating system settings you can associate mp3DirectCut to one or
more of these file types and with different options. Then you can open the
program easily by any file of that type. It is also possible to drag files of known
types over mp3DirectCut.
</p><p>
If you use the <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> parameter together with /rec you can set an
individual record filename that differs from the base filename of the recording settings.
</p><p>
The following <b>options</b> can be used to let the program perform an action
immediately. After finnishing, the program quits.
</p><p class="note">Note: <b>adjustments</b> for Normalize, Auto cue, Encoder settings
and so on cannot be given over the command line. They must be made before in the normal
program environment.

<td>Replaces the original file on /save or /normalize. The current "Keep date of source file" setting is
valid (it can be set in the program environment). If /overwrite is not set, the given file extension will be
appended once more.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>/rec</b></td>
<td>Starts the recording immediately. This feature is especially made for timer recordings. In a scheduler
usually you can also set a duration time after which the program will be terminated. For multiple timer
recordings be sure to check <b>Add date and time</b> or <b>Append data</b> in the recording settings,
otherwise previous recordings will be overwritten. If a filename is given before the /rec option and <b>Add
date and time</b> or <b>Append data</b> is not (!) selected, the program records into a file of that name.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>/localini</b></td>
<td>Regulary the program tries to write the settings into its own folder. If this fails, e.g. because of missing
rights, the settings are stored in the user's Application data folder. This option prevents the program from
reading from or writing to the user profile. This may be useful in special cases, e.g. if local settings are
needed when the program is running from a removable drive.</td>
